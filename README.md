# get away
ludum dare 2019 game. theme is 'your life is currency'.

i went with a very circular approach to the theme, and didn't really get to express it in the game. (oh well) player character is trying to escape from someone who views them as simply an object of value, to use for whatever nefarous plans they want.

## to-do for 1.0.0

   - trap revealed effects

## to-do for 1.5.0
* sound
  - door slam on start
  - walking sfx
  - something for the trap
  - background noise that increases as timer counts down
* cutscenes
  - on game load (skippable with keypress)
  - on success (skippable with keypress)
* character animations
  - better trap animation
  - timer loss animation (collapse)  
* bring all graphics up to the same quality level
* satisfying feedback/animations
  - spacebar animates when hit
